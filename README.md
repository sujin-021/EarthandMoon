# Earth and Moon Animation

This is a Processing-based art that simulates an orbiting moon, dynamic meteor trails, and twinkling stars in space. I was using arrays, trigonometry, and custom tail effects for visual storytelling in a space setting. 


# Technologies used 
- Java (Processing)


# Preview
[demo](./demomovie.gif)

> Meteor trails leave soft, glowing stars, while the moon orbits steadily.


# Features

- Orbiting moon using `cos()` and `sin()` for circular motion
- Meteor particles with trailing effects using array-shift logic
- 150+ stars with animated alpha twinkle
